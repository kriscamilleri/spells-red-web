# Spells.Red Web 

Spells.Red is a DnD spell search and spell book creation tool. 

This is the next version of https://spells.red, rewritten in Vue 3 using TailwindCSS for styling and Keycloak for authentication. Unlike its predecessor, this application expects a dedicated backend and not just a link to a JSON file. This project was inspired by the wonderful work of 5eTools by Giddy.
